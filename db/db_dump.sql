It can be solved by having a \"Dealer\", \"Rep\", \"Report\" and \"My Account\" tabs. now under heading main section there will be sub sections. If you click on Dealer it will default to the current \"see dealer\" section. Same with the reps, see reps. Then from there, there will be sub navigation that have \"add dealer\". Click that and it goes to the add dealer page. Same goes for rep etc.\r\nOn the main dealer tab; we just need the Dealer Name, City, State, Program, Phone. The dealer name should be a link that drills down into the \"edit\" section\r\nThe rep page should like Inside reps and then Outside. I think we just need to have their name right now and that is a link that when clicked goes to the edit section.\r\nAlso on the detail of the rep section we do not need base pay.\r\nAlso in the rep sections Title is job title, not mr/mrs.\r\nDealer Tab\r\nAddress: The mailing address section needs a check box that says; same as above or something so it populates those fields without having to re enter.\r\nMain Contact\r\nThe title for any of our users does not need to be the formal MR, MRS etc. On the main contact side we want this to be what his job title is. Another way to do the user section is to create an \"add new user\" button; and then there are the standard fields to enter and tehn there is a \"title\" drop down that has the predefined dealer titles there. That may make it easier from a space side rather than having all of the fields.\r\nWe are missing the delivery method of receiving the report; email or fax. This should be a check box and only one contact or user has to have a method defined. So if there is a main contact and they are checked but we have filled out the owner\'s info; we do not need to check a delivery method for them.\r\nPhone fields; the lay out should be 3 boxes with a max of 3, 3, 4; the number of characters in the corresponding fields.\r\n\r\nWe need to rethink the lay out of the dealer set up sections. This is going to evolve as we get going; but we will want to at least group all of those together.

The sample data we have from EXP AC, it does not have VIN. However, do they have data with VIN? it would be easy, if they did.

We will refersh these every month with the data refersh.\r\n3. We will pull down NADA BV data every month say on day 1 for the previous month (using period YYYYMM in the call) offline. We will append these data to our exisiting DB. We will pull data by region and The question is do we pull BV data for all new cars (incrmental) or for all cars including what we have in our DB. This will increase the refresh time needed but will allow us to see month over month valuation changes. How far back do we want to go?\r\n4. There are different types of value- default, msrp, high, low. Which one do we use? All this will return value for a default mileage. And we will also retrive mileage adjustment structure (using getMileageAdj() call) so that we can calculate values for similar vehicles with different milage.\r\n5. We should add dealers that we get from EXP AC as prospect. The dealer setup needs to be adjusted to look for the dealer in the DB beforing creating a new.

That is all good, except if you look at the detail page, you will see its almost impossible to achieve a GP of $4,600. The weighted average of the lowest price at auction is driving down the average auction price, while there were only a hand full of \"higher\" priced cars which is artifically inflating the book value price. If it was all weighted, you could expect an Average GP of about $2,500; which makes more sense.\r\n\r\nSo, with that being said, we are going to need to weight the Book Value number based on the number of cars through auction so we can properly compare the two values.\r\n\r\nTravis',5,2,'2009-02-16 07:00:00','2010-06-28 16:52:03'),(161,'Report Enhancements','We need to make a couple of report enhancements and/or tweaks.\r\n\r\nThe first is when we currently print out the report it cuts the date off the top left.\r\n\r\n-We need to put the dealer\'s name at the top to the right of the VM logo.\r\n\r\n-We should put the criteria of how we built the report at the bottom of the report.

Say for example, a lead may have HasCheckingAccount = true, However it may have AccountType = Savings. Because, the field called AccountType is the type of the account associated with the AccountNumber field in the request. Now, it may sound a little contradictory at the first look. However, say its very much likely that one actually has a checking account but the account number thats specified in the lead is not that checking account and indeed a savings account. So these two fields are captured.\r\nJust to assure you, we don\'t apply any logic to determine if an account number is a checking or savings one. Rather we just take the value thats specified in the lead as AccountType.\r\nNow regarding ESL, the filter is, the HasCheckingAccount field must contain a value equals to \'true\', but no filter is in place on the AccountType field. However, in the request that we send to ESL, we specify the account type associated with the account number, which may be a savings/checking account.\r\nI hope it clears the issue.

While it is still available to developer keys issued before December 5, 2006 they reserve the right to cancel it at any moment. For this reason, we favor the Yahoo! Maps Web Services for use from server-side code.\r\nThe Haversine formula is indeed precise and accurate, but can be complex. I appreciate your selection of this method, but please test it against results from using a simpler Pythagorean flat-Earth approximation.\r\nMoreover, I expect that use of the geocoding API will not be needed for most calls to the following two methods:\r\nbool AreAddressesWithinRange(Address address1, Address address2, double distance)\r\nbool ArePostcodesWithinRange(string postcode1, string postcode2, double distance)\r\nThis will save on time and network usage, as well as help us keep the number of requests to the external API within a daily limit.\r\nInstead, please see attached ZIP Code file. It has lat and long for each ZIP code in the U.S. If a call is made to see if one address with the ZIP code 99501 (Anchorage, AK) and a second with 33101 (Miami, FL) are within 30 miles of each other, an initial check of the ZIP-only lat/long values will tell you that they\'re about 5,000 miles apart, then there\'s no need to run a more network- and computationally-expensive check to see if they\'re within 30 miles. Just return a false straight away. Obviously, we\'ll need to arrive at a figure (I\'d guess about 6 miles) whereby we would check again for a precise result.\r\nI hope this is all fairly clear.',11,3,'2008-09-21 06:00:00','2010-06-30 20:50:42'),(288,'Test Release For GPS API','GPS Api is deployed in the test server in the url http://test.methoddirect.com/GPS/GPSService.svc.\r\n\r\nWe implemented six follwing functions:\r\n\r\nCoordinate GetCoordinatesByAddress(Address address);\r\nCoordinate GetCoordinatesByPostcode(string postcode);\r\ndouble GetDistanceBetweenAddresses(Address address1, Address address2);\r\ndouble GetDistanceBetweenPostcodes(string postcode1, string postcode2);\r\ndouble GetDistanceBetweenCoordinates(Coordinate coords1, Coordinate coords2);\r\nbool AreAddressesWithinRange(Address address1, Address address2, double distance);\r\nbool ArePostcodesWithinRange(string postcode1, string postcode2, double distance);\r\n\r\nNote that for the functions related to address and postal code we first check if the requested address contains zip code and no street information then we look up in the database provided to find the coordinate.

We are having our designer fix the issue and get you one that looks better / works w/ layout.\r\n2. Have you configured the email send portion yet? I tried to test this w/ using one of the lead id url\'s you provided, but then changing my email address in the app to one that I can access. Let me know.\r\n3. In the windows header for \"Loan Grab\", you mispelled as \"Lone\", please correct.\r\n4. In the gray bar directly above the email / zip, please replace text that currently reads: \"Apply For Cash Now\" to: \"Login to Submit for your Cash!\"\r\n5. Find & Replace changing \"PaydayQuickCash.com\" to \"LoanGrab.com\".\r\n6. Question marks are linking to home page of site, not the relevant answers.\r\nAdmin Side\r\n1. Is there a place where we can designate a specific url to go to in case of denial for this \"affiliate\" / traffic from LoanGrab.com only? Please show us where to do this.\r\n2. Can you add test functionality to the email template area that allow us to, in real time, send the constructed email to an address we enter to review look/feel of email?\r\n3. Please clarify \"End Call Script\"? When this would be shown? after telemarketer submits all collected fields??\r\n4. 1 Question about the redirect link that will be sent to consumer in case of success. We can\'t expose a link that includes customer ssn in it in an email or in a url. This needs to be protected.\r\nTSR Page\r\n1. Can you make it say: \"TSR Login\" instead of Telemarketer login ??',10,3,'2008-10-14 06:00:00','2010-06-30 23:03:41'),(296,'RE: Test release for Telco sites','We have modified test release for MMAdmin, MMTeleMarketerForm & Loangrab sites.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have worked on the comment posted. \r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n1. We have checked the sites in IE7/IE6 and in FF. We find these works. Please inform us if you face any difficulty.\r\n2. We will implement the SSL cert for loan grab in next sprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoanGrab.com (Consumer Facing Site)\r\n1. Please send us the logo if your designer fix the issue.\r\n\r\n2. Yes, we have developed the email sending portion. It will be sent to customer from telemarketer form site. Then the customer will log in his/her email account and follow the link given in the email. This link will contain only leadid not any part of SSN. By following the link, the customer will reach the loan grab site. Then he/she must have to give the same email and last 4 digit of SSN, he/she informed to telemarketer. Then he/she will be able to log in to loan grab site. Please use your email in telemarketer to test this functionality as you need to sign in to your email account to check the inbox.\r\n\r\n3. \"Lone\" - spelling mistake is corrected.\r\n\r\n4. \"Apply For Cash Now\" - it is actually an image not any text. It will be helpful for us if you send us an image containing \"Login to Submit for your Cash!\".\r\n\r\n5. Please clarify us the problem you mentioned in \"Question marks\". We have developed the link for \"Question marks\" according to PDQC site.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmin Side\r\n1. We have created an affiliate in admin test panel named loangrab. You can edit exit/denial URL there.\r\n\r\n2. We will do the task - \"test functionality to send the email template\" in next sprint.\r\n\r\n3. \"End Call Script\" will be shown if the customer\'s birth year infers that his/her age is under 18. This is the sixth question of the initial 7 questions where the telemarketer ask the customer - What year were you born?\r\n\r\n4. Redirect link does not include any part of SSN. We have mentioned it earlier. \r\n\r\n\r\nTSR Page\r\n1. We have made \"TSR Login\" instead of \"Telemarketer login\". \r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion\r\n1. What will be the subject of the email?

Telemarketer Account Management:\r\nA new page is added for managing telemarketer account.When a new telemarketer is created an affiliate for the telemarketer will also be created.

I tested updating an email template, then went to save and received a \"runtime error\".\r\n2. On the admin, can you organize the nav bars a bit more so that under a Telemarketer link, the following options become available; a. Add/Delete TSR (functionality seen in current telemarketer link), b. Add/Delete TSR Co c. Templates, d. Questionairre\r\n3. We need to be able to have telemarketers set up in a console outside of the main admin screen. Specifically, we\'ll need to allow for managers of given telemarketer companies be responsible for setting up their own agents w/out viewing any of the other data in our main admin. The only functionality they would have would be to add/delete their reps. In order to make this work, there\'s a few things we\'ll need to do as below;\r\na. In our admin, under the Telemarketer Nav bar we should have the ability to create a TSR COMPANY, along w/ a un & login for the main company administrator that WE can establish on our admin page.\r\nb. When setting up an individual Telemarketer, company name will come from a drop-down only of created companies.\r\nc. New subdirectories will be created on the back of loangrab.com for each new TSR company, that will allow for login of that given company and will allow their admin to login w/ un & pw we would have already established for them to then add TSR users to their company only. The login subdirectory will be: loangrab.com/companyname\r\nd. In setting up of both a company and telemarketer, you will need to establish initials for both, i.e., John Burns will be JB, and Acme Callcenter will be AC. If there are multiple JB\'s or AC\'s, you will need to add a fixed number to the back of the call center name, 1,2,3, etc. I realize that there are a lot of scenarios (1 word company names, etc.) that will make this confusing. Please PROPOSE how you would handle this to mitigate confusion / and for ease of use.\r\n4. On templates page, I had selected send email and it was not received.\r\n5. On LoanGrab Page, if someone tries to login w/ a record that is not found, there should be a validation message displayed, \"Please try again with correct information.\"\r\n6. Can you clean up this page a bit so that the fields and use of space look more visually appealing, move the terms/conditions statement up, more equidistant space between different form fields, top of page, etc.\r\n7. Lower right column says; LoanGrag, all should say LoanGrab.com\r\n8. None of the test leads above in your original message are working now / allowing us to re-log in.\r\n9. Previously, I had clicked the question marks and nothing happened. This may have been an IE8 issue. But I am unable to test it right now due to the above login not working.\r\n10. We will want to configure the subject of the email using some of the the wildcards.\r\n11. Re: your question: Is there any site deployed in the IP 72.32.154.159? Is there a way you can check w/ rackspace or dnsstuff.com / other online tools & see? I didn\'t think so, but please check.\r\n12.

Then attempts to assign them.\r\nFattahul: norbert will create a list of transporter upon these 2 logic and make the job assigned to them one by one until anyone accepts\r\nme: exactly\r\nI just realized we probably need a new \"cost\" field on the jobs model for the final cost worked out between the shipper and his transporters\r\nand when a shipper dispatches a job directly to a transporter, this cost is already worked out between them.\r\nSo when Norbert logic runs...job.cost=$Y if transporter.job.accepts?\r\n',16,4,'2009-03-19 06:00:00','2010-07-05 18:10:56'),(416,'We have successfully moved to rails 2.3 and rolled out in test server','Kevin,\r\n\r\nWe have moved manywheels to rails 2.3.1 and also rolled out in test server.

The basic idea of the job_assignment table is that it manages the relationship between jobs and transporters. As transporters are notified, accept, reject, timeout, etc. a job this table will track it.\r\n\r\nWhen we have the Norbert logic in place, I imagine that the table will be populated with the ordered list of transporters that correspond to this business logic when a job is dispatched (initially this list is all based on price). Generating and automatically dispatching jobs to the \"best\" transporter is the key differentiating factor for ManyWheels. For example\r\n\r\njob_assignments table:\r\nid						1, 2, 3, 4\r\njob_id: 					1, 1, 1, 1	\r\ntransporter_id				22, 23, 45, 77\r\ntransporter_response 		Reject, Timeout, Timeout, Notify\r\ntransporter_comment		\"I can\'t deliver until Thursday\", nil, nil, nil\r\nIf transporter_id==77 Accepts the job, his transporter_response goes to accept. job_state for job_id==1 changes at this point from published to accepted.\r\n\r\nCouple of issues:\r\n\r\n1. Standardizing the names\r\n\r\nWe should probably document and agree to the following:\r\n\r\njob_states: Draft, Published, Accepted, Exception, Closed, Cancelled\r\n\r\ntransporter_response: Notify, Accept, Reject, Timeout\r\n\r\nAgree?\r\n\r\n2. Shipper assigning a job to a specific transporter\r\n\r\nWe want to give shippers the option to assign a job to a specific transporter when they create a job. This might also be used when they get feedback from transporters after an exception and resubmit.\r\n\r\nHow should we handle this event? I see two possible ways:\r\n\r\n1. We could add another column to the jobs table for assigned_transporter. This is probably the easiest to implement. Ultimately this assignment will mean that we bypass the Norbert logic (unless job.job_assignment.nil?) and populate the jobs_assignments table with this assigned_transporter (when job_state goes from Draft to Published) rather than the list of \"best\" ones selected by Nobert.\r\n\r\n2. When a job is saved (job_status==Draft) we populate the job_assignments table with the transporter selected in job create/edit. Somehow when then have to tell Norbert not to populate the table.

I think the intent is to keep all jobs in the database. A job can exit the statemachine in either closed or canceled state, correct?\r\n3. What causes exception?Is it a state?\r\n4. Don\'t we need a open state that corresponds to the case when all approved transporters reject, the is available for others to see?\r\n5. Can a transporter reject a job after accepting it?\r\n6.

So, for example, if you send a request for 2007 Ford Taurus â€“ Getlistings will return the pre-sale listing information for all 2007 Ford Taurusâ€™ listed (depending on your search criteria for location, sale date, etc); while get(sale)summaries will return the number of sale events, as well as the number of Ford Tauruses that meet your search criteria.\r\n \r\nAlso, with respect to on-going customer support â€“ attached is the customer support guide and below is a summary:\r\nWe use a rotating pool of Level 1 and Level 2 technical support resources.  So, there are a few support options available to your team: 1) you can e-mail your questions webservices@manheim.com  (pre and post implementation) and we will open up a service request ticket for you and it will be forwarded to the appropriate Level 2 support resource, if necessary.  Depending on the priority level assigned to the service request â€“ resolution times may vary between 2-5 business days (e.g., for minor issues unrelated to system operations, or when the web service still performs its primary functions, or when the user simply needs clarification); 2) you may call 800-377-4343 and request a service ticket; 3) If there are a series of in-depth questions and you would like to speak real-time to a Developer, I can schedule a conference call with a representative from our Development team (depending on schedules, this also may take 2-5 business days).
