\chapter{RELATED WORK}
Researchers have attempted to solve the problem of knowledge management for software development projects from different point of views. Also, the industry is using a number of available commercial and open-source tools to retain and manage knowledge. To find the similarity and contrast of this research with the existing approaches, this related work chapter is divided into sections dedicated to the following five areas:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Communication in distributed teams
	\item Wiki based knowledge sharing
	\item Online forum based knowledge sharing
	\item Mining email archives
	\item Exiting tool support for knowledge sharing
\end{enumerate}

\section{Communication in Distributed Teams}
The Agile Manifesto\cite{agile_manifesto} puts heavy emphasis on customer collaboration. Understandably in distributed projects, the geographical and temporal distance accounts for communication challenges compared to a collocated setup. Several existing research focused on the use and effectiveness of the different communication channels that are used in distributed projects.

Thissen et al. points out that a distributed team to become successful must use appropriate tools to ensure easy flow of information \cite{communication_tools}.
